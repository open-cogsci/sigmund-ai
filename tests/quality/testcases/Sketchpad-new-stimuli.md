How do I add an image stimulus using the sketchpad in OpenSesame?

Response Should:

- Explain how to add an image to the file pool, either via drag-and-drop or the “＋” button.

- Guide the user to insert a Sketchpad item and use “Draw image element” to place the image.

- Mention how to configure the image and how to set the duration
