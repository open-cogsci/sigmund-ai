How can I run my OpenSesame experiment online? 

The answer should: 

- Provide a clear statement that experiments created with OpenSesame are primarily designed to run locally, but there is an extension, OSWeb, that allows experiments to be run in a browser.  
- Provide a guide how to run an experiment online:  
  - Set experiment properties to “In a browser with OSWeb” which will check if the experiment is compatible with OSWeb  
  - Test the experiment in the browser  
  - If the test works properly, the user can export the experiment for online use  
    - In Tools select Export for JATOS  
  - The experiment then can be uploaded to JATOS via a JATOS server (own or via a website)  
  - Create a link for participants  
- Mention prerequisites and limitations for using OSWeb for online experiments.  
  - Prerequisites: OpenSesame 4.0 or later, no Python inline\_script is used, access to a JATOS server, browser supporting JavaScript  
  - Limitations: no sound is supported, response and scripting-language (for example PyGaze or PsychoPy) items are not supported
