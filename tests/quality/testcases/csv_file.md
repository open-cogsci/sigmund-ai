For my experiment, I’ve prepared the trial conditions in a .csv file. Is it possible to use this file in OpenSesame to run the experiment?

The answer should:

- Inform the user that it is possible to use the file instead of making a table.   
- Direct the user to the loop item in their experiment sequence. In the item they can set the “Source” from table to file. Then, they can upload the file either from their file pool OR the computer.
