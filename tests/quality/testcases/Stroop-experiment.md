How can I design a Stroop task on OpenSesame to measure participant’s reaction time based on a key press. I would like the participants to press: “m” when the word is red, “z” when it’s blue and “v” when it’s yellow.

The answer should:

Explain the basic layout of the experiment and where to define the variables:
Sequence
Loop to define variables
Sketchpad with a fixation dot– central “+”
Sketchpad to present the coloured word
Keyboard_response
Logger - record reaction time and accuracy 
Specify that trial conditions should be defined in the Loop item, including a correct_response variable that matches the response key for each trial.
Mention how to use the colour variable (or similar variable) to set the font colour in the Sketchpad item.
Explain to set the allowed responses to desired keys (m, z and v) and make sure that reaction time is being recorded in the keyboard response item
