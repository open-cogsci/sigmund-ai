I am running an eye tracking study with the Eyelink tracker. However, I received an error message “Failed to start recording” after calibration. What would possibly cause the issue? 

The answer should:

- Explain to the user what the error means
- List most common causes of the error, such as the tracker is in the wrong mode (Calibration instead of Track), lost signal after calibration, previous experiment sessions was not closed
